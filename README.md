nano-prepowtx can stress test the Nano network by precomputing transactions and spam them at indicated time intervals.

Attacks can last forever, sending incredibly small amounts of Nano between locally owned accounts.

This method uses the nano-node rpc interface and so a local nano-node running on port 7076 is required.

The attacks that nano-prepowtx performs are specifically listed in the Nano whitepaper as:

B. Transaction Flooding
D. Penny-Spend Attack
E. Precomputed PoW Attack
